# Factorio Quickbelt

This is a mod for [Factorio](http://factorio.com) for making belt placement
easier. Place a belt or row of belts, then shift+click a destination to connect
the belts. The mod will orient the belts in the right direction, use
undergrounds to avoid obstacles, and handle multiple belt corners.
